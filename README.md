# Movie Podcast
This application displays Movie viewing history and consumes movie data from [The Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/) API. You can find movies by search functionality, view the details of the movie and add your review. It also shows you the list of movies you've watched and lets you update your review.

The application is bootstrapped using Vite and built using React + Typescript and Material UI and is unit-tested with Jest and React Testing library.
